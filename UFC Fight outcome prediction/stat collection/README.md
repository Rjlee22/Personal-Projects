<h2> What is going on in this folder? ðŸ¤” </h2>
Using the links scraped from scraping materials, this is where we can extract all of the relavent data for this project!
This includes 4 different files: 

1. UFC event data- tells us where the event happened, when it happened, etc 
2. UFC fight details- tells us how many rounds the fight went, who won, weight class, if it was a title fight, etc
3. UFC event stats- tells us how many strikes landed, takedowns attempted, control time, etc for each fighter 
4. UFC fighter stats- tells us how much each fighter weighs, where they are from, reach, height, etc

With these files, we will soon use it for predictive analytics...
